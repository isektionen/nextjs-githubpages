[![github-pages](https://github.com/isektionen/nextjs-githubpages-example/actions/workflows/github-pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/isektionen/nextjs-githubpages-example/actions/workflows/github-pages.yml)

Minimalistic example of a static [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) web app deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/).

## Example or it didn't happen

The result of this repo is live [here](https://isektionen.github.io/nextjs-githubpages-example).

## Ok, cool. How do I get started?

Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Clone the repo

```
git clone git@github.com:isektionen/nextjs-githubpages-example.git
```

Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

Run local server

```
npm run dev
```

You should be all set by now. Time to go crazy!

## I want to do this by myself

Sure. There's really not that many steps. Check out the [commit history here](https://github.com/isektionen/nextjs-githubpages-example/commits/main).

## Is there anything I can improve?

- Image URL in `pages/index.js` is hard coded with the deployed app's base URL `/nextjs-githubpages-example/`. This does not work when running locally. Can we find a better solution here?

## I have so many questions!

Ping me anywhere and I'd be happy to answer them.
