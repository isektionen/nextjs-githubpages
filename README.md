# nextjs-githubpages

[![github-pages](https://github.com/isektionen/nextjs-githubpages-example/actions/workflows/github-pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/isektionen/nextjs-githubpages-example/actions/workflows/github-pages.yml)

Template for a static [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) web app deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/).

## Example or it didn't happen

The result of this repo is live [here](https://isektionen.github.io/nextjs-githubpages-example).

## Create a repo from this template

Follow the official instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

## I've created the repo. Now what?

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

Run local server

```
npm run dev
```

You should be all set by now. Time to go crazy!

## I want to do this by myself

Sure. There's really not that many steps. Check out the [commit history here](https://github.com/isektionen/nextjs-githubpages-example/commits/main).

## What needs to be improved on the template?

- Image URL in `pages/index.js` is hard coded with the deployed app's base URL `/nextjs-githubpages-example/`. This does not work when running locally. Can we find a better solution here?

## I have so many questions!

Ping me anywhere and I'd be happy to answer them.
