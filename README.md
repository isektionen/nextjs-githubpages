## Can I help out?

Yes! Some suggestions below:

- Image URL in `pages/index.js` is hard coded with the deployed app's base URL `/nextjs-githubpages-example/`. This does not work when running locally. Can we find a better solution here?

## I have so many questions!

Ping me anywhere and I'd be happy to answer them.
